## Game


![Screenshot of preview]()

## Rules
- The winner is the 1st player that gets to exactly position 100. 
- If a dice roll goes past cell 100, you will go backwards depending on the remainder. 
- Players cannot be on the same position. The newly landed player will overtake the former's cell, who will go to 0.
- The turn order will be determined with a dice roll - largest roll starts first. 
- Landing on the bottom of a ladder will allow you to move up to the top of the ladder :) 
- Landing on the head of the snake will lead you to go down to the snake's tail :( 
- Have fun!!
