# snakes-and-ladder
> Snakes and Ladder simulation game coded in Java. Includes Javadoc documentation.

## Game
This program is based on the traditional board game, Snakes & Ladders. Containing 100 squares, there are various snakes and ladders scattered throughout the board. The player will roll a dice (using a random number generator) to move. The 1st player to cell 100 wins the game! However, beware of traps - poisonous snakes along the way might drag you down, while convenient ladders will quicken your climb. 

The current version of the game only supports 2 players.
